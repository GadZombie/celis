# Compilation

Celis was created in Turbo Pascal 7.0 by Borland International Inc.
The best compiler to compile souces is TP or Borland Pascal. It's almost the same. There is a free Borland Pascal Compiler to download in the internet, so if you need it, you'll find it. I cannot distribute it because it's not my software.

All needed source files should be included in this repositiory. Main file to start is `celis.pas`.

# The code

This is a Polish game. I was creating it when I was young and learning to code, so this code is not top quality. Almost all variable and type names are Polish, so it could be hard to understand for foreigners. You'll see also there is a big mess in the code, ugly formatting etc. Sorry, it was my fault. You may believe me, but today I don't code like that :)

# The purpose of this repositiory

Do what do you want with this code. Maybe you'll learn, maybe have fun. Maybe you'll fix something or change. The only thing I wouldn't like you to do is changing the credits for my game and release it anywhere. Please, keep in mind, it was my game and I sacrificed many months of work on it. And it all was always free. I deserve credit for this game and this code. Even if it's not the best quality. Thanks.
